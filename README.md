This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Sravani Baswaraj(She/her) and I am currently a student at CMU pursuing my master’s in information systems and Management. I have a bachelor’s degree in information technology. I have explored various concepts in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Mining. My half year of experience at the start-up, gave me an idea of the various ways data could be used and the significance of cloud (specifically Google Cloud). This experience of mine has inspired me to pursue becoming a cloud architect.

# What I hope to learn
During my studies, I have done many Data Science Projects. The most impactful part of this process is the presentation of results. Quite often it happens so that my presentations have too many charts and figures. A neat presentation often has a precise amount of information and I find it difficult to remove any charts that I have made. I have never particularly paid any attention to the colors in these diagrams either, going for pre-built templates available in the software. Through this course, I think my main takeaways would be:
* To understand the use of color to strategically represent data.
* To concisely present data according to the narrative.
* To be innovative in my representations.
